a.) The purpose of #ifndef/#define/#endif statements are to prevent multiple
    inclusions, ensuring that if the card.h file was included twice, the compiler would
    only see it once. (Ensures each file is only included once in one compilation.)

b.) A reference to another card object

c.) As the card will duplicate primitive values such as colour and int, and includes no pointers,
    there would be no difference between the shallow or deep copy so it will conduct neither
    a shallow or deep copy, but just a copy.

d.) It doesn't need a default constructor as a constructor has already been made. If a default constructor
    was called, there would be no way to tell what colour and number the card has.

e.) No it is not a good idea as there is already a getRule() function in the class. It is best to just call
    the getRule() function and just print the result, instead of having a dedicated function within the class 
    to print out the result for you.
